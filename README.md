# Quota
CONTRIBUTORS: Allan Mugweru.

This project is a website whose function is to display and generate quotes for motivational purposes.

The website is operational and all its functionalities are working well. These are reading on a variety of quotes from different authors. Voting on those quotes by clicking the like or dislike button. seeing when the quote was uploaded to the website. And finally being able to create your own quote and hosting it on the website.
